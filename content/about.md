Hello! I'm Kim Lehtinen, a Software Engineer based in Finland. My core belief is that everyone possesses a unique superpower, a distinct ability to contribute positively to our world. That's what I aspire to do through technology, and hope I can inspire others along the way to do the same, in their own unique way.

## My mission
In today's fast-paced world, technology stands as a pillar of progress and innovation. As a software engineer working mainly in the energy and industrial sector, I am committed to leveraging this power to make a tangible difference. My role involves crafting advanced systems, developing innovative tools, and optimizing processes that drive success across these sectors. By doing so, I try to contribute to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future. I hope to inspire others to do the same along the way.

## Background
I have a MSc (dipl.ins., DI) degree in Automation & Computer Science, from University of Vaasa. This was part of their Energy & Information technology programme, giving me great insight into the energy sector, by studying basics in both electrical and energy engineering during my bachelor's degree, in addition to computer science. My master's studies consisted of computer science, software engineering & computer/embedded engineering. This degree gave me good tools to understand how the digital world can contribute to a more sustainable future.

The last few years I have worked mainly in the energy sector. I have helped design and develop serveral cloud-based systems and tools, all aimed at helping companies within the energy sector to succeed and gain a competitive advantage. If I can help them succeed, we are one step closer to a more sustainable future.

## Beyond work
When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, I like to spend my time being active, usually by going for long walks or mountain biking. And speaking of sports, football has always been a big part of my life. It has provided me with incredible moments, and lessons that I will bring with me throughout my life.

I believe it's important to do things outside of work that gives you energy, fuels your creativity and inspires you to become the best version of yourself. Life is not a sprint, it's a marathon.

## Connect with me
I believe in the power of collaboration and the exchange of ideas. If you're interested in the intersection of technology and sustainability, or if you'd like to discuss the latest trends in software engineering, feel free to connect with me. Together, let's explore how we can use our unique abilities to leave the world a little better than we found it.
