Hi! My name is Kim Lehtinen, and I'm a Software Engineer. My days mostly consist working with backend software development, DevOps and Cloud.

I have a MSc (dipl.ins., DI) degree in Computer Science, from University of Vaasa.

I’m currently on a journey of specialising in backend development, and learning Cloud Native technologies. These technologies are truly powerful and changing the computing world. Here you can follow along on my journey where I write about things I’ve learned lately.

Other interests of mine are: XC MTB, football & music.
